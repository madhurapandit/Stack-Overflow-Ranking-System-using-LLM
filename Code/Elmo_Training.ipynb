Probably best would be to use an on-disk form, for instance a sqlite database, one of the dbm modules.\n","For a minimal change in your interface, the shelve module may be your best option - this puts a pretty transparent interface between the dbm modules that makes them act like an arbitrary python dict, allowing any picklable value to be stored. Here's an example:\n","# Create dict with a million items:\n","import shelve\n","d = shelve.open('path/to/my_persistant_dict')\n","d.update(('key%d' % x, x) for x in xrange(1000000))\n","d.close()\n","\n","Then in the next process, use it.  There should be no large delay, as lookups are only performed for the key requested on the on-disk form, so everything doesn't have to get loaded into memory:\n",">>> d = shelve.open('path/to/my_persistant_dict')\n",">>> print d['key99999']\n","99999\n","\n","It's a bit slower than a real dict, and it will still take a long time to load if you do something that requires all the keys (eg. try to print it), but may solve your problem.\n","**********************************************************************************************\n","4\n","I have implemented this by handling Workbook_SheetActivate, Workbook_SheetSelectionChange and Workbook_WindowActivate. Realistically this is probably enough.\n","**********************************************************************************************\n","5\n","I assume this is the plant for a closed-loop system with gain compensation only (that would be K).  In that case I would express it as a transfer function and then use the root-locus command to see where it hits on the x-axis:\n","num = [1 25];\n","den = [1 24 100 0];\n","\n","sys=tf(num,den)\n","rlocus(sys)\n","\n","Unfortunately your system appears to be stable for all values of K!
